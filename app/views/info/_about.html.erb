          <p> There should be a place for us to feel free to nerd out, geek out, be wonderfully weird and excited about building stuff. A space free of judgment, and full of creativity, pedagogy, and collaboration. Egos should be left outside, and positivity should take over.Blhackathon wants to provide that environment.</p>
          <p> It’ll be the chance to be ourselves, and get to know one another while collaborating on interesting projects. Let’s build a community.</p>
